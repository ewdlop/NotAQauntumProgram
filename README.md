## 心物盒一 (Mind-Matter Box One)

This repository contains an implementation of "心物盒一" (Mind-Matter Box One), a philosophical thought experiment that explores the relationship between consciousness (mind) and physical reality (matter).

### What is the Mind-Matter Box?

The Mind-Matter Box is a conceptual framework that examines how mental states and physical states might interact within a contained system. Unlike quantum mechanical experiments, this focuses on the philosophical aspects of consciousness and reality.

### Key Concepts

- **Mind-Matter Duality**: The box contains both physical and mental states
- **Observer Effect**: The observer's intent influences the observed states
- **Superposition**: The box can exist in multiple states until observed
- **Meditation**: Contemplative states that generate insights about consciousness

### Usage

Run the demonstration:

```bash
python3 mind_matter_box.py
```

### Features

- Observable states that depend on observer intent
- Superposition states representing unobserved possibilities
- Meditation functionality for philosophical reflection
- Not actually quantum mechanics (hence "NotAQuantumProgram")

### Philosophy

This implementation explores questions like:
- How does consciousness interact with physical reality?
- Can mental states influence physical outcomes?
- What is the nature of observation and awareness?
- How do we understand the mind-body relationship?
